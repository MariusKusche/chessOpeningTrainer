# chessOpeningTrainer
A simple opening trainer for the game chess, where the user provides the opening

This trainer needs pygame (see https://www.pygame.org/news) to function.

Short description:

Until now all lines in the opening you choose have to be played from the first move until the end of the variation. In future there will be an update where one only
plays from the first move which deviates from the mainline. This will be added in the next update.

Some Remarks:

Also there are some little inconveniences, which are partially declared in the files, e.g. one player can move to times in a row if the conditions are met like 
e4 e5 both with white

How to use:

The opening txt-file you provide (or the one that is here given) must be named in the main file "chessOpeningTrainer.py" and the format is as indicated by the
example file. The main line is the first line and then the variations come afterwards in new rows.
